# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a Prework Study Guide Webpage for University of Texas at Austin edX Full Stack bootcamp.

- My motivation is to obtain a more fulfilling career path, to further my knowledge in technology and the evergrowing internet and place myself in the role of a creator, versus an end user.
- The project's sole intention is to learn the basics of different languages and their purposes with regard to software development. Although high level at this point, this type of foundational structure is integral to higher learning.
- This project solves the issue of vocal/visual learning of the topics and real world implementation of the subject matter.
- Throughout this exercise, I have grasped the operations of Git, which personally has been a tough topic to wrap my head around in the past. It also has served as a great tool to prepare me for the upcoming bootcamp classes, in regards to HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
  I am immensely excited to continue the learning path onto a more fulfilling and exciting career!
